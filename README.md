# Awesome React app with all the sweet tooling

Scaffolded with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Added then sw-cache, redux, redux-saga + others I haven't implented yet.

Start the app with `yarn start`. (Requires it to be globally installed with `npm i -g yarn` or use alternatively `npm start`)

Use Redux DevTools, it's cool: http://extension.remotedev.io/
